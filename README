Milan's Multi Key Binary Search - mmkbs
=======================================

Abstract:

The Milan’s Multi-key Binary Search is an algorithm for fast search of multiple keys in a sorted
array of values. The algorithm is based on classical, i.e. one-key binary search and uses it as its
fundamental part, additionally it takes advantage of the knowledge obtained from its previous
results to adjust the boundaries of each next binary searches and so lower the amount of values that
will be searched by binary search. The algorithm has one limitation, it needs to obtain its keys
input sorted, otherwise it is not guaranteed and also highly probable that some of the searched keys
won’t be found. Time complexity of the algorithm is a function of two variables and is logarithmic
considering both of them. The algorithm has no limitation regarding to amount of keys.

For detailed description, please see file mmkbs_draft.pdf which si present in this repository.

In the time of writing the draft (Oct 2017) this should be
the worlds fastest multi key binary search algorithm.

We found a similar work named:
"A New Algorithm for Tiered Binary Search"
from July 2017, published by:
"Int'l Conf. Foundations of Computer Science | FCS'17 |"

However after investigation, I came to conclusion that this my new algorithm is faster.
